                  <p>The Greek God of Bollywood, Hrithik Roshan, did not actually make his debut on-screen with the movie Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai, but appeared as a dancer in a movie called Asha. The actor was only 6 years old at the time.</p>

                  <p>Not many of you might know this, but even Farhan Akhtar ventured in Hollywood, back in 2004. According to reports, the actor had penned down the lyrics of the blockbuster movie Bride And Prejudice, which also saw Aishwarya Rai as the lead. Apparently, he collaborated with his sister for the songs of the film, as per Javed Akhtar's recommendation. That's news to us! </p>

                  <img src="images/factsCeleb/pic3.png" alt="hockey">
                  <p>At the time when Sholay was being made, Dharmendra and Hema Malini's love story was blooming, to such an extent that the former paid extra money to the light boys during the shoot. Wondering why? The actor, apparently, wanted to keep reshooting the romantic scenes with Hema Malini over and over again.</p>

                  <img src="images/factsCeleb/pic4.png" alt="hockey">
                  <p>Many of us believe that the origin of the dialogue Enna Rascala was Rajinikanth but that's not true. The tag line Enna Rascala, Mind it, yes, became very popular and even if a person is not associated with South Indian films, most of us know this line and have heard it quite a lot. But turns out, the actor never used it. This dialogue was actually dubbed in a Tamil movie and somehow is associated with Rajinikanth but the real source of it is unclear.</p>

                  <p>Veteran actor Amitabh Bachchan also has a hidden talent, that never came in the limelight. The actor is actually ambidextrous when it comes to writing, meaning he has an ability to write with his right as well as his left hand, equally well. </p>
