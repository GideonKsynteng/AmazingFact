                  <img src="../images/historyfact/1history.jpg" alt="hockey">
                  <p>Beside, developing the subject of algebra proper, Indians also began a process of algebraisation and consequent simplification of other area of mathematics. For Instance, they developed trigonometry in a systematic manner, resembling its modern form, and imparted to its modern algebraic character. The algebraisation of the study of Infinitesimal changes led to the discovery of the key principles of Calculus at the time of Bhaskaracharya (1150 AD). Calculus in India reached astounding heights in the analytic trigonometry of the Kerala School in the 14th century. Though the Greeks discovered trigonometry, their progress was halted due to absence of adequate algebraic machinery and notations. Indians invented the sine and cosine functions, discovered most of the standard formulae and identities, including the basic formula for sin (A±B), and constructed fairly accurate sine tables.  </p>

                  <img src="../images/historyfact/zero.jpg" alt="zero">
                  <p>The discovery of Zero is the greatest abstraction of the human mind. It is not wrong to say that the concept or the invention of zero was revolutionary in mathematics. Zero is a symbol for the concept of nothingness or having nothing. It gives rise the ability for a common person to be able to do mathematics isn’t. Before it, mathematicians struggled to perform the simplest arithmetic calculations. Now a day’s zero both as a numeric symbol and a concept help us to do calculus, in solving complicated equations and is the basis of a computer.</p>

                  <h2>3. Chess (Shataranja or AshtaPada) was invented in India.</h2>
                  <img src="../images/historyfact/chess.png" width="725px" alt="chess">
                  <p>Today we know that chess originated from the Gupta Empire (600CE), of India. However many people firmly believe that chess was played by the ancient Egyptians. But, the game we think of as chess and what the Egyptians used to play are completely different. Simply put, the Egyptians played something different that resembled chess. Despite this, we really don't know who first came up with the game, but it can be traced officially back to India.

                    The pieces come from the primary military elements of that time: the infantry, the elephants, the calvalry and the chariots.
                    
                    Global trade eventually brought the game to Europe and around 1200CE the game undertook dramatic changes to become what it is today. In Italy and Spain, such changes gave their pawns the ability to move two squares on the first move, bishops their dominance over diagnals and queens their ability to move anywhere.
                    
                    During the 18th century, the center of the chess world switched to western Europe to areas like France. Matches were played in large coffee houses in large cities such as London and Paris. It wasn't until the 19th century that chess became widely known.</p>
